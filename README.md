# Challenge
Using the Balance Bots input file, identify what is the number of the bot that is responsible for comparing value-61 microchips with value-17 microchips?


# Example:

## Instructions:
```
value 1 goes to bot 1
value 2 goes to bot 1
bot 1 gives low to output 0 and high to output 1
```
## Simulation:
```
Bot 1 receives chips 1 and 2.
Bot 1 gives the lower chip (1) to Output 0.
Bot 1 gives the higher chip (2) to Output 1.
```
## Final State:
```
Output 0: 1
Output 1: 2
```
Find the bot responsible for comparing the values 1 and 2. Bot 1 is responsible for comparing the values 1 and 2. The answer is Bot 1.


# Criteria
