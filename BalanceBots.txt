You find a factory where robots are passing microchips to each other. Each robot needs two microchips to proceed. 
Once it has two, it gives one to another robot or puts it in an output bin.

Each microchip has a number, and robots follow specific instructions to decide what to do with each chip. 

You download the instructions:

value 3 goes to bot 1
value 2 goes to bot 1
bot 1 gives low to output 0 and high to output 1

Simulation:

1. Bot 1 receives chips 2 and 3.
2. Bot 1 gives the lower chip (2) to output 0 and the higher chip (3) to output 1.

Final State:

Output 0: 2
Output 1: 3


Task: Determine which bot is responsible for comparing the value-3 and value-2 microchips.
